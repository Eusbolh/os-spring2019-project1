How to compile, load and unload:
To compile run "sudo make" inside the folder

To load the module run "sudo insmod simple.ko p=304" after compiling the module(note p can be any value)

To check the output generated by your kernel module use command: "sudo dmesg | cat". Note that you can also use commands like tail, less instead of cat to display the kernel log.

To unload the module run "sudo rmmod simple"

To list loaded modules: "sudo lsmod"

To clean up the binaries in the folder: "sudo make clean"

Note that the output file name ("simple.o" in this case) in the first line of Makefile must match the name you give your kernel module source code file ("simple.c" in this case)
